Paunch
======

Paunch is a 2D game engine written in Go.

Development Status
------------------
Paunch is still heavily in development. As is, it's not really very useful to
anyone. Please check back frequently, as work is being done on Paunch almost
every day.

Dependencies
------------
Paunch needs a few packages before being built.

	go get github.com/chsc/gogl/gl33
	go get github.com/go-gl/glfw3

The package glfw3 needs the C glfw3 library installed to build correctly. See
[their repository](http://github.com/go-gl/glfw3) for more information.

Installation
------------
Once you have the dependencies installed, just run go get!

	go get github.com/Velovix/paunch
